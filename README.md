# Experiment-14

Aim: To understand and implement the concepts of Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, and Multilevel Inheritance in C++.

Software Required: Visual Studio

Theory: In C++, inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (derived class) to acquire properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (base class). This provides a way to establish a relationship between classes and promote reusability.
Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a derived class inherits from a single base class. This is the simplest form of inheritance in which one class inherits from another.
Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a derived class inherits from two or more base classes. This allows the derived class to combine the features of multiple base classes.
Multilevel Inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a class derives from another class, which in turn derives from another class. This creates a chain of inheritance.

Concepts Covered:
Single Inheritance: One class inherits from another.
Multiple Inheritance: A derived class inherits from more than one class.
Multilevel Inheritance: A class derives from another, forming a chain of inheritance.

Conclusion: In this experiment, we successfully implemented and observed the behavior of the following types of inheritance in C++:
Single Inheritance: A derived class inherits from one base class, allowing the reuse of functionality from the base class.
Multiple Inheritance: A derived class inherits from two or more base classes, combining functionalities from multiple sources.
Multilevel Inheritance: A chain of inheritance where a class inherits from another class, which in turn inherits from another, forming a hierarchy.

Understanding inheritance is key to writing reusable and maintainable code in object-oriented programming. It allows us to build a class hierarchy, making our code more modular, and enabling us to extend or modify existing code easily.
