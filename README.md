# Experiment-14

Aim: To understand and implement the concept of inheritance in C++ with examples of Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, and Multilevel Inheritance. The experiment explores how objects of derived classes can inherit properties and behaviors of parent classes.

Software Required: Visual Studio

Theory: In C++, inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (derived class) acquires the properties and behaviors (methods) of an existing class (base class). Inheritance provides the concept of reusability and supports the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

Single Inheritance: Involves a single base class and one derived class.
Multiple Inheritance: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.
Multilevel Inheritance: Involves a hierarchy where a class is derived from another derived class.

Concepts Covered:
Single Inheritance: A derived class inherits from a single base class.
Multiple Inheritance: A derived class inherits from two or more base classes.
Multilevel Inheritance: A derived class inherits from another derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.

Conclusion: In this experiment, we implemented Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, and Multilevel Inheritance in C++. Each inheritance type allows different ways of extending class functionalities:
Single Inheritance: One class inherits from another.
Multiple Inheritance: A class inherits from multiple base classes.
Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.
These inheritance models help in code reusability and provide a way to model real-world relationships in an object-oriented system. By understanding and utilizing inheritance, we can create more flexible, maintainable, and scalable C++ programs.
